## Features

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

- `frontend/`: The front-end part of the application built with React.
- `backend/`: The back-end server built with Node.js.

## Front-End (React)

- `TaskList.js`: The main component for displaying tasks and managing task operations.

### Getting Started

To run the front-end, navigate to the `frontend/` directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd frontend/
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Back-End (Node.js)
The back-end is a simple Node.js server that provides API endpoints for task management.

`server.js`: The main server file.
Getting Started
To run the back-end, navigate to the backend/ directory and execute the following commands:

```bash

cd backend/
npm install
node server.js
```

The server will start running at port 3000.
